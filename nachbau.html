polls are also criticized for being too accurate—

<span style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px">The</span> general attitude toward public opinion

cover and/or their “findings.” A good example
is the “Hite Reports” on human sexuality. While
enjoying considerable attention in the popular
press, Shere Hite was roundly criticized by the
research community for her data-collection
methods. For example, a 1987 Hite report was
based on questionnaires completed by women
around the country—but which women? Hite
reported that she distributed some 100,000 
questionnaires through various organizations, and
around 4,500 were returned.<br>
<span style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px">Now</span>, 4,500 and 100,000 are large numbers in
the context of survey sampling. However, given
Hite’s research methods, her 4,500 respondents
didn’t necessarily represent U.S. women any more
than the Literary Digest’s enormous 1936 sample
represented the U.S. electorate when their
2 million sample ballots indicated that Alf Landon
would bury FDR in a landslide.<br>
<span style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px">Sometimes</span>, people use the pretense of

your own home?” Or you may have been told you
could win a prize if you could name the president
whose picture is on the penny. (Tell them it’s Elvis.)

Here’s what the American Association for
Public Opinion Polling has said in condemning

<blockquote>A “push poll” is a telemarketing technique in
which telephone calls are used to canvass
potential voters, feeding them false or misleading “information” about a candidate under
the pretense of taking a poll to see how this
“information” affects voter preferences.
In fact, the intent is not to measure public
opinion but to manipulate it—to “push” voters
away from one candidate and toward the
opposing candidate. Such polls defame selected
candidates by spreading false or misleading
information about them. The intent is to disseminate campaign propaganda under the guise
of conducting a legitimate public opinion poll.

<span style="padding:0px 0px 0px 20px">In</span> short, the labels “survey” and “poll” are
